## General info
This project is an assignment which purpose is for us to learn how to work with agile methods.
For this project we have chosen to work with the agile method SCRUM.

The assignment is to create a GUI (graphical user interface) for the mockup database Sakila where 
the user can use the basic operations of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) on majority of the 
tables of the database. Views are excluded.

The database will be connected to and altered through the use of the [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/ "Named link title") framwork.
The choice of architecture of the project is currently an altered version of the MVVM (Model–view–viewmodel) architecture with a (abstract) -/factory pattern in mind. Mainly for
its ability to create low coupling thorugh inversion of control, dependecy injection, and code independecy which enhances workflow without git interference.
