The spring security implemented requires hashed passwords to login 
The users registered upon running the program do not have hashed passwords
So you run the program on eclipse
Open live view on home.html and register a user.
With the new registered user you can then login to "http://localhost:8081/login"
It will redirect you to "http://127.0.0.1:5500/home.html" which is the home page
Here you can then login using the predefined users that you can find in "http://localhost:8081/h2-console" or in the eclipse data.sql, below are some with pass and username.
 ('password1''username1'), an admin
  ('password3''username3'), an ordinary user
Because of the way the code in vscode connects to the backend, most operations throws a failure exception even though it is ok, just ignore that, still trying to figure out a walk around it but have to submit now.

In summary, login to "http://localhost:8081/login" logs you into the system that has users found in data.sql. so it requires two logins
